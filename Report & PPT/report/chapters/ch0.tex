\section{Overview}
\par In the recent times, there has been too much involvement of technology in every sphere of life. Be it banks, finance, quantitive finance, biology, etc, the amount of data is immense and the use of this data to predict few properties has become  essential. Banking is one such field, where from years to years amount of data has been collected and now all these data is being used to predict factors like default of credit cards, default of loans, prediction of share markets for investment, corporate banking, etc.\par We took the project of using machine learning methods for predicting the default of credit cards. We analysed different machine learning techniques and compared them with each other. Our work included an algorithm proposed by us which gives better accuracy.

\section{Motivation of the Research Work}\label{sec1.1}
Main motivation for our research work has been our fascination for Machine Learning and we wanted to do something for the greater good. Our work will help banks reduce giving loans to people who will take money from them and not return to them, thus not wasting money.
