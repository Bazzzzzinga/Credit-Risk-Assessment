{
The evaluation of credit risk is an important problem in the field of banking in today's world. The research is aimed at comparing various data mining techniques to predict default of credit card clients. This will help credit providers identify fraudulent customers before providing credit. In this project we used six state-of-the-art methods namely Logistic Regression, K-nearest neighbours, Neural Networks, Naive Bayesian, Decision Trees and Support Vector Machines and proposed a technique to generate more and better features, given enough features. Results have been evaluated for two data sets, one of Taiwan from 2005 and other of Europe from 2013.
